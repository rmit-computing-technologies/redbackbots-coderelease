# Test Behaviours

This directory contains basic demo classes alongside a list of skills

They can be started with the `-s` skill flag.  ./redbackbots -s [SKILL NAME]
For example, to run the `WalkAround.py`, you could type:
  
    redbackbots -s WalkAround

Then stiffen, give the robot a few metres of room to move and watch.
