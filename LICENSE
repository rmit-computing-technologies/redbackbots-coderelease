Preamble: RedbackBots as part of the AI Innovation Lab at RMIT University
releases software it uses at RoboCup competitions
for the benefit of the RoboCup community, including teams in the
Standard Platform League. We intend to enable teams to benchmark their own scientific
approaches in RoboCup competitions. We also hope that the scientific community
will benefit through the publication of their findings. A second reason for
RedbackBots releasing its code is that source code is the most solid 
documentation of how problems were actually solved.

This distribution contains software developed by:
* UNSW Sydney, Australia
* B-Human (http://www.b-human.de)

Parts of this distribution were not developed by RMIT University. This license
doesn't apply to these parts, the rights of the copyright owners remain.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:
1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright
   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above
   copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following
   disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided
   with the distribution.

3. The end-user documentation included with the redistribution, if
   any, must include the following acknowledgment:
   "This product includes software developed by RedbackBots, AI Innovation Lab, RMIT University."
   Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software
   itself, if and wherever such third-party acknowledgments
   normally appear.

4. If the source code or parts of the source code shall be used
   for a RoboCup competition, the competing program must differ in
   at least multiple major parts from the original distribution.
   "Major parts" means own contributions to the RoboCup goal, which
   are potentially publishable and usually manifest themselves as
   new modules (i.e. source code) and not just as a parameterization
   of existing technology (e.g. walking parameters, kicks, behavior
   options).

5. For each RedbackBots code release from which parts are used in a
   RoboCup competition, the usage shall be announced in the SPL
   mailing list (currently robocup-nao@lists.robocup.org) one month
   before the first competition in which you are using it. The
   announcement shall name which parts of this code are used.
   It shall also contain a description of the own contribution
   that addresses the criterions mentioned above.

6. Bug fixes regarding existing code shall be sent back to RMIT University.
